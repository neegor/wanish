##About

This package allows you to summarize text by reducing an article in size to several sentences retaining the idea of the text.

Besides of that the package extracts the following from the document:
 - Canonical URL of the article
 - Title of the article
 - URL of the image characterizing this article
 - Strips the document of excessive information (headers, footers, navigation, advertisement, etc.) and forms a clean HTML based on structured data of schema.org

easy_install wanish
or
pip install wanish

```python
from wanish import Wanish

wanish.perform_url(document_url)

# getting doc's source canonical url
url = wanish.url
